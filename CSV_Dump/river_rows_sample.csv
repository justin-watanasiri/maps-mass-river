History:
The Acushnet River was foundational to the earliest European settlers who made their homes on its shores, providing them with water, food, and travel.
The river's banks were home to many mills, especially on the New Bedford side of the river. 
The river's mouth, which forms a small but well-sheltered harbor, has long served as the home port of New Bedford's commercial fishing fleet. It is also the birthplace of New Bedford's whaling industry.

Did You Know?
-The name ""Acushnet"" comes from the Wampanoag or Algonquian word, ""Cushnea"", meaning ""as far as the waters"", a word that was used by the original owners of the land in describing the extent of the parcel they intended to sell to the English settlers from the nearby Plymouth colony.
-On the river's eastern (Fairhaven) shore, the mouth of the river is guarded by Fort Phoenix, a fortification that was involved in 1775 in the first naval engagement of the American Revolutionary War.",,
